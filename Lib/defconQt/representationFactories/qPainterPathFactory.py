"""
The *qPainterPathFactory* submodule
-----------------------------

The *qPainterPathFactory* submodule provides a QPainterPath_ representation of
a Glyph_'s outline.

QPainterPath_ is the Qt class for Bézier paths. It accomodates cubic or
quadratic outlines and has a pen interface.

You can then draw such paths on screen with the QPainter_ method
``drawPath()``.
